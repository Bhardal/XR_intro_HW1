> This is the Github repository for the **Introduction to XR Systems**' Homework 1 : **The Room**

___

This is a Unity VR project you are in a cubic room along with a light and a planet and it's moon.<br>
The light's base color is White (255,255,255) and the planet's base rotation speed is 0.00415 degrees per second - equivalent to a full rotation every 24h. <br>
Outside of the Room is a Custom made Skybox, created from one of my Minecraft Texture packs.
